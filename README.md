# InterestRates
I started this project because someone at my workplace proposed the idea to obtain data based on:

    * Interest Rates  
    
    * GDP  
    
    * Gold prices  
    
    * Inflation Rates  
    
    * Property Price Index  
    
    * Currency Prices
    
and to analyse and see if there's a link between these and deposits in a bank.

However, they were the ones promising to provide the deposits data, so until they do I may just try and see if I can predict interest rates using some of this info instead.
